SoapUI Regressor TestStep Plugin
Compares the responses of all requests contained in given test suite's test case.

Possible Enhancements:
    - Presently comparison of responses is String based comparison. Need to enhance it to compare XML, JSON etc. based on attributes.
    - Enhance it to do XML comparison regardless of order.
    - Provide flexibility to exclude attributes while comparing responses.
