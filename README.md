SoapUI Regressor TestStep Plugin

Compares the responses of all requests contained in given test suite's test case.

Possible Enhancements:

    - Response comparison is String based. Need to enhance it to compare XML, JSON etc. based on attributes.
    - Enhance it to do XML comparison regardless of order of attributes.
    - Provide flexibility to exclude attributes while comparing responses.
    - Provide better UI for Regression Results Viewer:
        - include compparison response in UI.
        - replace Jtabs with better UI component for easy viewing f multiple responses.
        - capability to show diff between responses side by side.
